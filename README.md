# This is hub testing repos

I am creating this repos from commnad line, using hub gem.
I am testing if I can create a GitHub repos from command line, not from the web browser.
by doing hub create

## I will see what happens.

Hey it worked!!!

### I was able to create new repo.

1. git init    # from my local machine.

1. hub create  # this created a repo on GitHub with same name as the local git folder name.  

1. git remote add origin master 

1. git push -u origin master

Now this is done! 

### After this is up in the GitHub

I can edit using Prose.io

### I commit this

I want to detect if new commit was made from local machine.
